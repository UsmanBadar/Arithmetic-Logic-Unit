# Arithmetic Logic Unit

## Description:
This arithmetic logic unit(ALU) is based on the The Elements of Computing Systems book [chapter 2](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project02). This ALU is built in circuit simulator [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/). It takes two 16-bit inputs and performs the operations mentioned in the truth table, attached with this project. This project starts from fundamental logic gates and finishes at ALU.

## How to run:

1: Go to [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/)\.

2: Launch simulator and then select project and then select import file to upload the file.

### Input:
Two 16-bit inputs with 8 instruction bits which should be set according to the truth table to respective operations.

### Output:
Output is a 16-bit and 3 flags to indicate carry, negative and zero output.
